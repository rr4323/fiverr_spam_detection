# Fiverr Spammer Detection System

## 1. Project Overview
A machine learning system to detect and prevent spam activities on Fiverr platform using user behavior analysis and pattern recognition.

## 2. Problem & Solution
  ### Problem:
   Recently attackers are using freelance job sites such as Fiverr to distribute malware disguised as job offers. These job offers contain attachments that pretend to be the job brief but are actually installers for keyloggers such as Agent Tesla or Remote Access Trojan (RATs). Due to this many users lost their earnings, bidding fees and fake client projects, also some users lost their accounts too. Many of the LinkedIn connections faced it and some of them lost their professional growth, side income and stability.

  This project is about to understand how data science people will solve this problem by using their different methods and techniques. 

  Columns in the Training Set
      • label - indicates whether or not the user became a spammer. A "1" indicates the user became a spammer, a "0" indicates the user did not become a spammer.
      • user_id - the unique ID of the user
      • Columns X1 through X51 are different parameters that a user took before or after registering to the platform. This could be things like "whether or not the username contains an underscore" or "the number of characters in the users email" or "whether a user came from a valid referrer (i.e. google, bing, or another site)." Due to privacy issues, columns for all of these parameters have been named X with a following number.
### Solution: 
ML-based detection system using Random Forest classifier with 300 trees

## 6. Column Analysis & Interpretation
### 6.1 LLM-Based Column Analysis
Using LLM with spammer behavior expertise, we analyzed the top important features to hypothesize their potential meanings:

- **Top Features Analysis**:
  1. AccountAge_Seconds (0.2261) - Account age in seconds
     - High importance suggests spammers often have newer accounts
     - Pattern: Shorter account age correlates with higher spam probability
     - Range: 0 to 1,000,000 seconds

  2. MessagesSent_Total (0.0761) - Total number of messages sent
     - Spammers typically show higher message frequency
     - Pattern: Sudden spikes in activity often indicate spam behavior
     - Range: 0 to 1,000 messages

  3. MessagesSent_Last30Days (0.0680) - Messages sent in last 30 days
     - Recent activity patterns differ between spammers and legitimate users
     - Pattern: Unusual activity patterns in short timeframes
     - Range: 0 to 500 messages

  4. AccountVerification_Level (0.0620) - Account verification status
     - Spammers often have incomplete or unverified accounts
     - Pattern: Lower verification levels correlate with spam
     - Categories: Unverified, Basic, Premium, Enterprise

  5. ProfileCompleteness_Score (0.0592) - Profile completion score
     - Spammers tend to have incomplete profiles
     - Pattern: Profile completion inversely related to spam probability
     - Range: 0 to 100
