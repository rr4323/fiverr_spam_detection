### 4. Visualization Summary
The following visualizations have been generated in the plots directory:

#### 4.1 Overall Analysis

   - Shows the balance between spammer and non-spammer classes
2. **PCA Scatter Plot** (`../plots/eda_plots/pca_scatter.png`)
   - 2D projection of the data using principal components
3. **Pair Plot** (`../plots/eda_plots/pairplot_top_features.png`)
   - Scatter plots showing relationships between top features
4. **Feature Importance Plot** (`../plots/eda_plots/feature_importances.png`)
   - Bar plot showing the importance of each feature
5. **Missing Values Analysis** (`../plots/eda_plots/missing_values.png`)

- **X1** (`../plots/eda_plots/X1_distribution.png`)
  - Box plot showing distribution by class
- **X2** (`../plots/eda_plots/X2_distribution.png`)
  - Box plot showing distribution by class
- **X19** (`../plots/eda_plots/X19_distribution.png`)
  - Box plot showing distribution by class

  - Box plot showing distribution by class
- **X22** (`../plots/eda_plots/X22_distribution.png`)
  - Box plot showing distribution by class

### 5. Key Findings

1. **Class Imbalance**:
   - The dataset shows a {summary['class_distribution']['spammer']:.1%} / {summary['class_distribution']['non_spammer']:.1%} split between spammers and non-spammers
   
2. **Feature Importance**:
   - The top features account for significant predictive power
   - Behavioral features show strong discrimination between classes
   
3. **Data Quality**:
   - {summary['missing_values']} missing values identified
   - {len(high_corr_features)} highly correlated feature pairs found

### 6. Recommendations

1. **Feature Selection**:
   - Consider using the top {len(summary['top_important_features'])} most important features
   - Evaluate removing one feature from highly correlated pairs
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values using median imputation
   - Scale features before model training
   
3. **Model Development**:
   - Consider using class weights or sampling techniques due to class imbalance
   - Focus on features with high importance scores
   - Monitor for potential overfitting due to correlated features

### 7. Next Steps

1. Feature engineering based on top important features
2. Implementation of recommended preprocessing steps
3. Model selection and training with focus on handling class imbalance
4. Regular monitoring of feature importance in production
