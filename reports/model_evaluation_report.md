# Spammer Detection System - Model Evaluation Report

## 1. Executive Summary
After evaluating 20 different machine learning models for spammer detection, the Random Forest (300 trees) model has been identified as the best performing model. This report details the evaluation process, results, and final recommendations.

## 2. Model Evaluation Criteria
